# Marketin Laravel Bridge

Marketin Laravel Bridge is a lightweight helper that drops the Marketin JavaScript SDK and a self-initialising bridge script into any Laravel application. A single Blade directive renders the SDK, injects a configuration blob, and loads the bridge that wires URL attribution, Livewire events, and conversion tracking.

## Features

- One-line Blade directive (`@marketinScripts`) that loads the official Marketin SDK and passes a signed config payload to the bridge.
- CDN defaults for both the SDK (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ayg3/sdk@latest/marketin-sdk.min.js`) and the bridge bundle—no publishing step required.
- Environment-driven configuration so each deployment can set the required brand identifier (with optional fallbacks).
- Optional `@marketinTracking` directive to push structured events into the data layer you already use.
- Extensible helper that accepts per-render overrides for advanced pages or A/B tests.

## Requirements

| Dependency | Version |
|------------|---------|
| PHP        | 8.2+    |
| Laravel    | 10.x, 11.x, or 12.x |
| Node.js    | 18+ (only for maintainers rebuilding the bundle) |
| NPM        | 9+ (only for maintainers rebuilding the bundle) |

---

## Quick start

```bash
composer require ayg3/marketin-laravel-bridge

# In your base layout <head> tag:
@marketinScripts()
```

Set `MARKETIN_BRAND_ID` in your environment before deploying. Affiliate, campaign, and product identifiers will normally arrive via URL parameters when Marketin hands off traffic.

---

## Installation

### 1. Install the package

```bash
composer require ayg3/marketin-laravel-bridge
```

The service provider is auto-discovered; no manual registration is necessary.

### 2. Configure environment variables

Add the IDs Marketin assigned to you. The bridge will refuse to initialise if `MARKETIN_BRAND_ID` is missing.

```dotenv
MARKETIN_BRAND_ID=123
MARKETIN_CAMPAIGN_ID=456
MARKETIN_AFFILIATE_ID=789
MARKETIN_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.marketin.now/api/v1
```

You can leave the campaign or affiliate values blank if you plan to provide them per-page via the directive.

### 3. Add the Blade directive

Place `@marketinScripts()` once in your primary layout (typically inside `<head>`). The directive renders:

1. The Marketin SDK tag (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ayg3/sdk@latest/marketin-sdk.min.js`) with the required `data-navigate-once` attribute.
2. A configuration blob (`window.__marketInBridgeConfig`).
3. The Marketin bridge bundle.

---

## Configuration

The package ships with `config/marketin.php`. You do not need to publish it unless you prefer a file-based override; environment variables are sufficient for most teams.

### Environment variables

| Variable                        | Default                                                          | Description |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `MARKETIN_SDK_URL`              | `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ayg3/sdk@latest/marketin-sdk.min.js` | CDN location of the Marketin SDK. |
| `MARKETIN_BRAND_ID`             | `null`                                                           | **Required.** Your Marketin brand identifier. |
| `MARKETIN_CAMPAIGN_ID`          | `null`                                                           | Optional fallback campaign identifier; typical traffic supplies `cid` via URL. |
| `MARKETIN_AFFILIATE_ID`         | `null`                                                           | Optional fallback affiliate/advocate identifier; typical traffic supplies `aid` via URL. |
| `MARKETIN_DEFAULT_CAMPAIGN_ID`  | `null`                                                           | Secondary campaign fallback when neither URL parameters nor overrides are provided. |
| `MARKETIN_DEFAULT_AFFILIATE_ID` | `null`                                                           | Secondary affiliate fallback when neither URL parameters nor overrides are provided. |
| `MARKETIN_API_ENDPOINT`         | `https://api.marketin.now/api/v1`                                | REST endpoint consumed by the bridge. |
| `MARKETIN_DEBUG`                | `false`                                                          | Enables verbose console logging. |
| `MARKETIN_BRIDGE_URL`           | `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ayg3/marketin_laravel_bridge@latest/dist/marketin-bridge.js` | CDN location of the Laravel bridge bundle. |
| `MARKETIN_ASSET_PATH`           | `vendor/marketin`                                                | Target path if you choose to self-host the bridge. |
| `MARKETIN_BRIDGE_FILENAME`      | `marketin-bridge.js`                                             | Filename used when self-hosting. |
| `MARKETIN_TRACKING_ENABLED`     | `true`                                                           | Toggles the `@marketinTracking` directive output. |
| `MARKETIN_TRACKING_LAYER`       | `dataLayer`                                                      | Window variable that receives tracking events. |

### Bridge hosting

By default the directive loads the bridge from the CDN value in `MARKETIN_BRIDGE_URL`. If you prefer to host the file yourself, set `MARKETIN_BRIDGE_URL` to an empty string (or remove it) and follow the [self-hosting instructions](#self-hosting-the-bridge-optional).

## Usage

### Blade directives

| Directive             | Purpose |
|-----------------------|---------|
| `@marketinScripts()`  | Injects the SDK, configuration blob, and bridge script. Accepts an optional associative array of overrides. |
| `@marketinTracking()` | Pushes an event into the configured data layer. Also accepts overrides. |

```blade
@marketinScripts(['brandId' => 42, 'campaignId' => 1001])
@marketinTracking(['event' => 'marketin.conversion', 'value' => 99.95, 'currency' => 'USD'])
```

### Sample layout integration

```blade
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>{{ config('app.name') }}</title>

    @marketinScripts()
</head>
<body>
    {{ $slot ?? '' }}
</body>
</html>
```

### Tracking data-layer snippet

Place `@marketinTracking()` near the bottom of your layout if you want every page view sent to your analytics layer. You can also emit it ad-hoc inside campaign pages.

```blade
@marketinTracking([
    'event' => 'marketin.page_view',
    'brandId' => config('marketin.brand_id'),
])
```

### URL parameter intake

The bridge inspects the page URL every time it boots. If the query string contains `aid`, `cid`, or `pid`, those values are persisted to `window.sessionStorage` (stored under the `marketinParams` key) and merged into the payload that initialises the Marketin SDK.

```text
https://example.com/product/101?pid=101&cid=3&aid=8
```

- `aid` → `affiliateId` / `advocateId`
- `cid` → `campaignId`
- `pid` → `productId` (consumed when `marketin:conversion` events fire)

Once `@marketinScripts()` is in your base layout the bridge picks up those parameters automatically, keeps them around for later page loads (including Livewire transitions), and falls back to whatever you supplied via overrides or configuration. Effective precedence is:

1. URL parameters (`aid`, `cid`, `pid`)
2. Values passed into `@marketinScripts([...])`
3. Defaults from `config/marketin.php` / environment variables

The Marketin platform issues customer-facing links containing these parameters, so most teams leave campaign and affiliate IDs blank in their configuration. Overrides exist purely as an escape hatch for bespoke flows or testing.

Both `marketin:conversion` and `marketin:subscription` events pull the stored identifiers into their payloads before calling the Marketin SDK, so conversions and recurring revenue events stay attributed without extra code.

#### Custom query parameter names

If you receive different query parameter names (for example `affiliate` instead of `aid`), normalise them before the directive runs so the bridge can still discover them. A lightweight middleware keeps the logic centralised:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;

class NormalizeMarketinParams
{
    public function handle($request, Closure $next)
    {
        $mapping = [
            'affiliate' => 'aid',
            'campaign' => 'cid',
            'product' => 'pid',
        ];

        foreach ($mapping as $incoming => $expected) {
            if ($request->query->has($incoming) && ! $request->query->has($expected)) {
                $request->query->set($expected, $request->query($incoming));
            }
        }

        return $next($request);
    }
}
```

Register the middleware in `app/Http/Kernel.php` (for example inside the `web` group) so every request presents the expected keys to the bridge. For a one-off page you can also pass overrides directly to the directive:

```blade
@marketinScripts([
    'affiliateId' => request('affiliate'),
    'campaignId' => request('campaign'),
    'defaultCampaignId' => config('marketin.default_campaign_id'),
])
```

The bridge still honours the precedence list above, so explicit overrides win whenever the canonical query parameters are missing.

#### Product conversion example

Here is a minimal product page that relies entirely on URL-provided identifiers. The `data-marketin-conversion` attribute emits a conversion payload, while the stored `pid` becomes the product identifier sent to Marketin.

```blade
@extends('layouts.app')

@section('content')
    <main class="product">
        <header>
            <h1>{{ $product->name }}</h1>
            <p class="price">${{ number_format($product->price, 2) }}</p>
        </header>

        <button
            type="button"
            class="btn btn-primary"
            data-marketin-conversion='{"value": {{ number_format($product->price, 2, '.', '') }}, "currency": "USD"}'
            data-marketin-product-id="{{ $product->id }}"
        >
            Purchase
        </button>
    </main>
@endsection
```

When a visitor lands on a Marketin link such as `https://example.com/product/101?pid=101&cid=3&aid=8`, the bridge attaches the `pid`, `cid`, and `aid` captured from the URL to the conversion event fired when the button is pressed. If you omit `data-marketin-product-id`, the stored `pid` automatically becomes the product identifier.

## Self-hosting the bridge (optional)

If corporate policy requires hosting the bridge script yourself, run the publish command once and clear the CDN override:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=marketin-assets
# then set MARKETIN_BRIDGE_URL= in your .env file
```

The file will be copied to `public/vendor/marketin/marketin-bridge.js`. Future package updates may ship a newer bundle; rerun the command after upgrading.

> **Note:** Only teams that self-host need to run `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=marketin-assets`. CDN users can skip this step entirely.
